1. Introduction The Personal Portfolio Website is an internship project designed to showcase my skills, projects, and resume. The goal of this project was to develop a fully functional, visually appealing, and interactive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helped me gain practical experience in front-end web development, UI/UX design, and responsive web development.
2. Objectives The main objectives of this project were:
•	To create a professional online presence.
•	To display personal and professional details effectively.
•	To showcase my software development projects in an organized manner.
•	To implement interactive features for better user engagement.
•	To ensure the website is fully responsive and accessible on different devices.
3. Technologies Used
•	HTML: Used for structuring the content and defining various sections.
•	CSS: Applied for styling, layout design, and responsiveness.
•	JavaScript: Used to enhance interactivity and validate form inputs.
4. Features & Functionality The portfolio website consists of the following main sections:
•	Home Page: Includes an introduction with my name, a brief bio, and a professional layout.
•	About Page: Provides more details about my education, work experience, and personal interests.
•	Projects Page: Displays a gallery of projects with titles, descriptions, and images. Each project is dynamically generated using JavaScript.

•	Resume Download: Provides an option to download my resume as a PDF.
5. Challenges & Solutions During the development of this project, I faced several challenges:
•	Ensuring Responsiveness: The website needed to be fully functional across different screen sizes. This was achieved using CSS media queries and a flexible grid layout.
•	Smooth Navigation: Implemented JavaScript-based smooth scrolling to improve user experience.
•	Dynamic Project Display: Used JavaScript to dynamically render project elements, allowing easier updates and scalability.
•	Form Validation: JavaScript was used to prevent users from submitting incomplete contact forms.
6. Conclusion The Personal Portfolio Website was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my front-end development skills. By working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design principles.
Future Improvements:
•	Adding a dark mode toggle for better accessibility.
•	Implementing a backend to store and retrieve messages from the contact form.
•	Enhancing the project gallery with filtering and sorting options.
